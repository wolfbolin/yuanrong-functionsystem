    1. The instance label only contains key. For instance affinity, the label selection condition can 
       only be set to ``LABEL_EXISTS`` or ``LABEL_NOT_EXISTS``. 
    2. Weak affinity/anti-affinity does not guarantee that an instance will be scheduled to a specified POD. 
       If no POD that meets the conditions is found, other PODs with resources may be selected for scheduling.
